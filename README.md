# AgroMartz

AgroMartz is a full-stack, web-based agricultural marketplace platform designed to connect farmers directly with consumers while providing administrators with complete control over system operations. The application aims to improve transparency, reduce middlemen, and enable fair pricing in agricultural trade.

The system is developed using a modern, service-oriented architecture. The frontend is built with React.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offering a responsive and user-friendly interface for buyers and administrators. The backend is implemented using Java (Spring Boot) and .NET-based microservices, exposing functionality through RESTful APIs to ensure loose coupling, scalability, and efficient communication between services.

MySQL is used as the relational database to store user information, farmer data, product details, orders, and transaction records. The application supports role-based access, where administrators manage farmers, products, categories, and orders, while users can browse products, add items to cart, and place orders through a seamless workflow.

By combining Spring Boot, .NET microservices, and REST APIs, AgroMartz demonstrates a scalable backend design capable of future expansion. The platform is designed with extensibility in mind, allowing future integration of advanced features such as automated logistics, secure authentication mechanisms, real payment gateways, and analytics.

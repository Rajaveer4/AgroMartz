## 🚀 Overview

**AgroMartz** is a full-stack, web-based agricultural marketplace platform designed to connect farmers directly with consumers while providing administrators with centralized control over system operations.

The platform aims to:

* Improve pricing transparency
* Reduce dependency on middlemen
* Enable fair trade practices
* Digitize agricultural commerce

It is built using a **modern service-oriented and microservices-driven architecture**, ensuring scalability, loose coupling, and long-term extensibility.

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

AgroMartz follows a **hybrid architecture** combining:

* Spring Boot backend services
* .NET-based microservices
* RESTful API communication
* React-based frontend
* MySQL relational database

### 🔄 High-Level Flow

* React.js
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* Axios for API communication
* Responsive UI design

### 🔹 Backend

* Java 17
* Spring Boot
* RESTful API design
* Maven build system

### 🔹 Microservices

* .NET-based independent services
* Decoupled business logic modules
* Scalable service communication

### 🔹 Database

* MySQL

## ✨ Core Functionalities

### 👤 Role-Based Access System

The platform supports multiple user roles:

#### 🛡 Administrator

* Manage farmers
* Manage products & categories
* Monitor and control orders
* Oversee system operations

#### 🌾 Farmer

* List and manage agricultural products
* Update availability and pricing

#### 🛒 Consumer

* Browse products
* Add items to cart
* Place orders through seamless checkout workflow

## 🔐 Design & Security Considerations

* RESTful API-based communication
* Clear separation of frontend and backend
* Modular service structure
* Extensible authentication framework (ready for secure JWT/OAuth integration)
* Designed for real payment gateway integration
